7. TECHNICAL SUPPORT. Once you have licensed the Software, priority 
technical support is available via a support ticket system for three (3) months
from the date of purchase.  Additional priority technical support can be
purchased in one (1) month intervals at the then current rates.  Purchase of
additional domain licenses does not include additional priority technical
support.  Technical Support can be accessed through our Owners Lounge.

Standard support is available free of charge for the lifetime of your license
through our owners lounge help forums.  Our standard support service has a 
minimum 48 hour response time.  If you have an urgent issue that you need a
response to, we recommend using our priority support service which can be
purchased for a small fee if your three (3) months of included priority
support have expired.

Technical support may be discontinued for older versions of our products at
any time.  If you are using a version for which support has been discontinued,
you will need to upgrade to a newer version in order to receive further
support.

In order to receive technical support, you must have an unedited copy of the
Software running on your server.  The only sections of code that you may edit
are those that are mentioned in the documentation for the Software.  Any other
editing of the Software will result in the loss of technical support.  We do
not provide technical support for modified Software.

For priority technical support requests, please allow 24 hours for a response.
We do not have a 24-hour staff to handle the requests we get, so please be
patient when requesting assistance.  For standard support requests, please
allow a minimum of 48 hours for a response.  We do not provide telephone
correspondence for sales or tech support at this time.  We are a small company
with limited resources, and are not able to offer that service.  To date, we 
have been able to successfully resolve ALL tech support issues through e-mail
and the help boards, so just because we don't offer phone support doesn't mean
we can't help.  Some issues may require that we login to your server through a
shell or FTP.  If you are unable or unwilling to provide us with login
information, we may be unable to assist in troubleshooting the problem.  In
these cases you will need to handle your own troubleshooting.

The tech support staff will be able to assist you with problems you encounter
with the Software itself (software generated error messages).  It is assumed
that your server meets the requirements of the software.  The tech support
staff can not offer server administration services to get your server properly
configured to run the software.  Configuring the software templates to match
your site, setting up banners for your members to use, etc. is solely your
responsibility.  If you are having problems getting your site to look how you
want it, we can offer limited template support by identifying which files need
to be edited and what the available template options do.   It is assumed that
you have a solid understanding of HTML on the source level.  The tech support
staff members are not HTML developers, and cannot provide you with any template
customization services.  If you do need to have a template created, we may be
able to offer that service for an additional charge.

If you alter or modify the Software which results in the Software ceasing to
function or not to function properly, there will be an additional fee if you
require us to correct the error.


8. REFUND POLICY.  We do not refund any monies for return of the 
Licensed Product.  ALL SALES ARE FINAL.  The operating system and other
requirements are clearly stated, so make sure that your system meets those
requirements before you purchase the Licensed Product.  Prior to your purchase
you have the opportunity to view the demo and ask us questions to make sure
that the Software suits your needs - no refunds will be given on the basis that
the Licensed Product does not meet your requirements. Any refunds or charge-
backs processed without the consent of JMB Software, Inc. will result in legal
action against you for breach of the software license.


9. INSTALLATION POLICY.  If you require that we install the Software
for you, there is an additional fee for that service.  The fee varies based
on the product.  Current pricing can be found on our website or by contacting
the sales staff.

Installation consists of us asking you a series of questions, getting your
server login information, uploading all required files, setting all the 
variables according to your answers, and making sure the script is operating
properly within your server capabilities.  Once that is completed, we will
contact you with the information you need to begin working with the Software.

We do not setup any HTML for you, and we also do not setup cron scripts or
crontab entries if that is an option for the script you are purchasing.  A 
standard installation is done based on the installation instructions provided
with the software.  Utilities, add ons, and both optional and required modules
for the software to function are not included in the installation unless
specifically noted at the time of purchase.  The Software comes with default
HTML, and that is what will be used during the installation.  All modifications
to the software templates must be created and entered into the script by 
yourself or your site's webmaster.  This is done through a web based interface
wich allows you to modify the HTML code and template values.

During the installation we will attempt to setup the script so that it can send
e-mails.  Unfortunately, some servers have restrictions on web software sending
e-mails, so this is something we cannot guarantee.  All other functions of the
Software are covered in the basic installation.

By providing your login information to us for installation services you are
authorizing us to access your web site, make changes, create directories,
upload files and all other necessary actions to get the software installed and
operating pursuant to our standard specifications.  Additionally, you are
permitting us to retain the login information for future technical support,
should it be needed and for removal of the Software in the event your license
is terminated pursuant to the terms hereof.  You will indemnify and hold us
harmless for all damages that arise from our access to your site and hold us
harmless for, and hereby expressly assume all risk for, any violation of your
agreement with your web site host or provider.

Installation services are only available for servers that meet the software
requirements.  We do not offer installation services for servers that do not
meet the software requirements.

The installation fee covers the initial installation of a single instance of
the software you have purchased the service for.  Any upgrades or additional
installations will require an additional fee.  Unless specifically requested,
all installations are done with the latest stable release of the product you
purchase.  Installation of beta versions will only be done if specifically
requested at the time of purchase


10. CONFIDENTIALITY AND LINKING. Your personal information will be kept
confidential and will not be disclosed to a third party unless we are presented
with a court order ordering us to do so.  The Software may enable collection of
personally identifiable information and you as the owner are solely responsible
for compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.

We reserve the right to use your web site URL as an example for other potential
customers to view.  We reserve the right to link to your site whenever you are
using the Software.  The Software contains links to our web site at the bottom
of some of the pages. This is done to provide us with an inexpensive way of
advertising, and in turn allows us to offer you the most affordable prices 
possible.  Removal or alteration any of these links is strictly forbidden.  If
your web site is found to have removed or altered the link, your Owner's Lounge
access will be permanently disabled and this License Agreement terminated.  We
offer a special version of the Software for an additional fee that does not
contain links to our site.  Beta or other types of test releases may not have a
link removed version available.
